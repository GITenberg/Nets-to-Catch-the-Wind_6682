  BEAUTY<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Say not of Beauty she is good,<br />
  Or aught but beautiful,<br />
  Or sleek to doves' wings of the wood<br />
  Her wild wings of a gull.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Call her not wicked; that word's touch<br />
  Consumes her like a curse;<br />
  But love her not too much, too much,<br />
  For that is even worse.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O, she is neither good nor bad,<br />
  But innocent and wild!<br />
  Enshrine her and she dies, who had<br />
  The hard heart of a child.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="eagle"></a>
  THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Avoid the reeking herd,<br />
  Shun the polluted flock,<br />
  Live like that stoic bird,<br />
  The eagle of the rock.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The huddled warmth of crowds<br />
  Begets and fosters hate;<br />
  He keeps, above the clouds,<br />
  His cliff inviolate.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When flocks are folded warm,<br />
  And herds to shelter run,<br />
  He sails above the storm,<br />
  He stares into the sun.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If in the eagle's track<br />
  Your sinews cannot leap,<br />
  Avoid the lathered pack,<br />
  Turn from the steaming sheep.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If you would keep your soul<br />
  From spotted sight or sound,<br />
  Live like the velvet mole;<br />
  Go burrow underground.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And there hold intercourse<br />
  With roots of trees and stones,<br />
  With rivers at their source,<br />
  And disembodied bones.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="madman"></a>
  MADMAN'S SONG<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Better to see your cheek grown hollow,<br />
  Better to see your temple worn,<br />
  Than to forget to follow, follow,<br />
  After the sound of a silver horn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Better to bind your brow with willow<br />
  And follow, follow until you die,<br />
  Than to sleep with your head on a golden pillow,<br />
  Nor lift it up when the hunt goes by.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Better to see your cheek grown sallow<br />
  And your hair grown gray, so soon, so soon,<br />
  Than to forget to hallo, hallo,<br />
  After the milk-white hounds of the moon.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

  THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  _"The Hielan' lassies are a' for spinnin'<br />
  The Lowlan' lassies for prinkin' and pinnin';<br />
  My daddie w'u'd chide me, an' so w'u'd my minnie<br />
  If I s'u'd bring hame sic a prinkin' leddie."_<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now haud your tongue, ye haverin' coward,<br />
  For whilst I'm young I'll go flounced an' flowered,<br />
  In lutestring striped like the strings o' a fiddle,<br />
  Wi' gowden girdles aboot my middle.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In your Hielan' glen, where the rain pours steady,<br />
  Ye'll be gay an' glad for a prinkin' leddie;<br />
  Where the rocks are all bare an' the turf is all sodden,<br />
  An' lassies gae sad in their homespun an' hodden.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  My silks are stiff wi' patterns o' siller,<br />
  I've an ermine hood like the hat o' a miller,<br />
  I've chains o' coral like rowan berries,<br />
  An' a cramoisie mantle that cam' frae Paris.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ye'll be glad for the glint o' its scarlet linin'<br />
  When the larks are up an' the sun is shinin';<br />
  When the winds are up an' ower the heather<br />
  Your heart'll be gay wi' my gowden feather.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When the skies are low an' the earth is frozen,<br />
  Ye'll be gay an' glad for the leddie ye've chosen,<br />
  When ower the snow I go prinkin' an' prancin'<br />
  In my wee red slippers were made for dancin'.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It's better a leddie like Solomon's lily<br />
  Than one that'll run like a Hielan' gillie<br />
  A-linkin' it ower the leas, my laddie,<br />
  In a raggedy kilt an' a belted plaidie!<br />

  AUGUST<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Why should this Negro insolently stride<br />
  Down the red noonday on such noiseless feet?<br />
  Piled in his barrow, tawnier than wheat,<br />
  Lie heaps of smoldering daisies, somber-eyed,<br />
  Their copper petals shriveled up with pride,<br />
  Hot with a superfluity of heat,<br />
  Like a great brazier borne along the street<br />
  By captive leopards, black and burning pied.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Are there no water-lilies, smooth as cream,<br />
  With long stems dripping crystal? Are there none<br />
  Like those white lilies, luminous and cool,<br />
  Plucked from some hemlock-darkened northern stream<br />
  By fair-haired swimmers, diving where the sun<br />
  Scarce warms the surface of the deepest pool?<br />
</p>

  THE CROOKED STICK<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  First Traveler: What's that lying in the dust?<br />
  Second Traveler: A crooked stick.<br />
  First Traveler: What's it worth, if you can trust<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To arithmetic?<br />
  Second Traveler: Isn't this a riddle?<br />
  First Traveler:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                    No, a trick.<br />
  Second Traveler: It's worthless. Leave it where it lies.<br />
  First Traveler: Wait; count ten;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rub a little dust upon your eyes;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, look again.<br />
  Second Traveler: Well, and what the devil is it, then?<br />
  First Traveler: It's the sort of crooked stick that shepherds know.<br />
  Second Traveler: Some one's loss!<br />
  First Traveler: Bend it, and you make of it a bow.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break it, a cross.<br />
  Second Traveler: But it's all grown over with moss!<br />

  ATAVISM<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I always was afraid of Somes's Pond:<br />
  Not the little pond, by which the willow stands,<br />
  Where laughing boys catch alewives in their hands<br />
  In brown, bright shallows; but the one beyond.<br />
  There, when the frost makes all the birches burn<br />
  Yellow as cow-lilies, and the pale sky shines<br />
  Like a polished shell between black spruce and pines,<br />
  Some strange thing tracks us, turning where we turn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  You'll say I dream it, being the true daughter<br />
  Of those who in old times endured this dread.<br />
  Look! Where the lily-stems are showing red<br />
  A silent paddle moves below the water,<br />
  A sliding shape has stirred them like a breath;<br />
  Tall plumes surmount a painted mask of death.<br />
</p>

  WILD PEACHES<br />

<p class="poem">
  When the world turns completely upside down<br />
  You say we'll emigrate to the Eastern Shore<br />
  Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;<br />
  We'll live among wild peach trees, miles from town.<br />
  You'll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown<br />
  Homespun, dyed butternut's dark gold color.<br />
  Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,<br />
  We'll swim in milk and honey till we drown.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The winter will be short, the summer long,<br />
  The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot,<br />
  Tasting of cider and of scuppernong;<br />
  All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all.<br />
  The squirrels in their silver fur will fall<br />
  Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">

</p>

<p class="poem">
  The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass<br />
  Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold.<br />
  The misted early mornings will be cold;<br />
  The little puddles will be roofed with glass.<br />
  The sun, which burns from copper into brass,<br />
  Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold<br />
  Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold,<br />
  Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover;<br />
  A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;<br />
  The spring begins before the winter's over.<br />
  By February you may find the skins<br />
  Of garter snakes and water moccasins<br />
  Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.<br />

  When April pours the colors of a shell<br />
  Upon the hills, when every little creek<br />
  Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake<br />
  In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell,<br />
  When strawberries go begging, and the sleek<br />
  Blue plums lie open to the blackbird's beak,<br />
  We shall live well--we shall live very well.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The months between the cherries and the peaches<br />
  Are brimming cornucopias which spill<br />
  Fruits red and purple, somber-bloomed and black;<br />
  Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches<br />
  We'll trample bright persimmons, while we kill<br />
  Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvas-back.<br />

  Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones<br />
  There's something in this richness that I hate.<br />
  I love the look, austere, immaculate,<br />
  Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.<br />
  There's something in my very blood that owns<br />
  Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,<br />
  A thread of water, churned to milky spate<br />
  Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,<br />
  Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meager sheaves;<br />
  That spring, briefer than apple-blossom's breath,<br />
  Summer, so much too beautiful to stay,<br />
  Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves,<br />
  And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death.<br />

  SANCTUARY<br />

<p class="poem">
  This is the bricklayer; hear the thud<br />
  Of his heavy load dumped down on stone.<br />
  His lustrous bricks are brighter than blood,<br />
  His smoking mortar whiter than bone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Set each sharp-edged, fire-bitten brick<br />
  Straight by the plumb-line's shivering length;<br />
  Make my marvelous wall so thick<br />
  Dead nor living may shake its strength.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Full as a crystal cup with drink<br />

  THE LION AND THE LAMB<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I saw a Tiger's golden flank,<br />
  I saw what food he ate,<br />
  By a desert spring he drank;<br />
  The Tiger's name was Hate.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then I saw a placid Lamb<br />
  Lying fast asleep;<br />
  Like a river from its dam<br />
  Flashed the Tiger's leap.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I saw a Lion tawny-red,<br />
  Terrible and brave;<br />
  The Tiger's leap overhead<br />
  Broke like a wave.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In sand below or sun above<br />
  He faded like a flame.<br />
  The Lamb said, "I am Love";<br />
  "Lion, tell your name."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The Lion's voice thundering<br />
  Shook his vaulted breast,<br />
  "I am Love. By this spring,<br />

<a id="bell"></a>
  THE CHURCH-BELL<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  As I was lying in my bed<br />
  I heard the church-bell ring;<br />
  Before one solemn word was said<br />
  A bird began to sing.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I heard a dog begin to bark<br />
  And a bold crowing cock;<br />
  The bell, between the cold and dark,<br />
  Tolled. It was five o'clock.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The church-bell tolled, and the bird sang,<br />
  A clear true voice he had;<br />
  The cock crew, and the church-bell rang,<br />
  I knew it had gone mad.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A hand reached down from the dark skies,<br />
  It took the bell-rope thong,<br />
  The bell cried "Look! Lift up your eyes!"<br />
  The clapper shook to song.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The iron clapper laughed aloud,<br />
  Like clashing wind and wave;<br />
  The bell cried out "Be strong and proud!"<br />
  Then, with a shout, "Be brave!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The rumbling of the market-carts,<br />
  The pounding of men's feet<br />
  Were drowned in song; "Lift up your hearts!"<br />
  The sound was loud and sweet.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Slow and slow the great bell swung,<br />
  It hung in the steeple mute;<br />
  And people tore its living tongue<br />
  Out by the very root.<br />

  A CROWDED TROLLEY CAR<br />

  The rain's cold grains are silver-gray<br />
  Sharp as golden sands,<br />
  A bell is clanging, people sway<br />
  Hanging by their hands.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Supple hands, or gnarled and stiff,<br />
  Snatch and catch and grope;<br />
  That face is yellow-pale, as if<br />
  The fellow swung from rope.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Dull like pebbles, sharp like knives,<br />
  Glances strike and glare,<br />
  Fingers tangle, Bluebeard's wives<br />
  Dangle by the hair.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Orchard of the strangest fruits<br />
  Hanging from the skies;<br />
  Brothers, yet insensate brutes<br />
  Who fear each others' eyes.<br />

  One man stands as free men stand,<br />

  BELLS IN THE RAIN<br />

<p class="poem">
  Sleep falls, with limpid drops of rain,<br />
  Upon the steep cliffs of the town.<br />
  Sleep falls; men are at peace again<br />
  Awhile the small drops fall softly down.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The bright drops ring like bells of glass<br />
  Thinned by the wind, and lightly blown;<br />
  Sleep cannot fall on peaceful grass<br />
  So softly as it falls on stone.<br />

  WINTER SLEEP<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  When against earth a wooden heel<br />
  Clicks as loud as stone and steel,<br />
  When snow turns flour instead of flakes,<br />
  And frost bakes clay as fire bakes,<br />
  When the hard-bitten fields at last<br />
  Crack like iron flawed in the cast,<br />
  When the world is wicked and cross and old,<br />
  I long to be quit of the cruel cold.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Little birds like bubbles of glass<br />
  Fly to other Americas,<br />

  Fly in the night to the Argentine,<br />
  Birds of azure and flame-birds go<br />
  To the tropical Gulf of Mexico:<br />
  They chase the sun, they follow the heat,<br />
  It is sweet in their bones, O sweet, sweet, sweet!<br />
  It's not with them that I'd love to be,<br />
  But under the roots of the balsam tree.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Just as the spiniest chestnut-burr<br />
  Is lined within with the finest fur,<br />
  So the stony-walled, snow-roofed house<br />
  Of every squirrel and mole and mouse<br />
  Is lined with thistledown, sea-gull's feather,<br />
  Velvet mullein-leaf, heaped together<br />
  With balsam and juniper, dry and curled,<br />
  Sweeter than anything else in the world.<br />
  O what a warm and darksome nest<br />
  Where the wildest things are hidden to rest!<br />
  It's there that I'd love to lie and sleep,<br />
  Soft, soft, soft, and deep, deep, deep!<br />

  The woman in the pointed hood<br />

<p class="poem">
  To her back door-step came a ghost,<br />
  A girl who had been ten years dead,<br />

  Now why should I, who walk alone,<br />

  Once, when my husband was a child, there came<br />
  To his father's table, one who called him kin,<br />
  In sunbleached corduroys paler than his skin.<br />
  His look was grave and kind; he bore the name<br />
  Of the dead singer of Senlac, and his smile.<br />
  Shyly and courteously he smiled and spoke;<br />
  "I've been in the laurel since the winter broke;<br />
  Four months, I reckon; yes, sir, quite a while."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He'd killed a score of foemen in the past,<br />
  In some blood-feud, a dark and monstrous thing;<br />
  To him it seemed his duty. At the last<br />
  His enemies found him by a forest spring,<br />
  Which, as he died, lay bright beneath his head,<br />
  A silver shield that slowly turned to red.<br />

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
